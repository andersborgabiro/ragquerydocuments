# RagQueryDocuments
RagQueryDocuments is a simple application that evaluates RAG for querying documents.

Bring-Your-Own-Key applies. You get no freebies from me.

GPT-4o seems to provide the best results, but GPT-4o Mini seems to be sufficient for basic queries and is considerably less expensive.

The application is accessible here: https://ragquerydocuments.streamlit.app/. This might change at any time. If so, the change will be posted here.

Contact me if you find something odd.

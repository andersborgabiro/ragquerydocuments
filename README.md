# RagQueryDocuments
RagQueryDocuments is a simple application that evaluates RAG for querying documents.

Bring-Your-Own-Key applies. You get no freebies from me.

GPT-4o seems to provide the best results, but GPT-4o Mini is probably sufficient for basic queries and is less expensive, except it sometimes gets the language wrong in the response.

The application is accessible here: https://ragquerydocuments.streamlit.app/. This might change at any time. If so, the change will be posted here.

No guarantees for it not breaking in the future, but the code is verified locally before updating it here, Contact me if you find something.

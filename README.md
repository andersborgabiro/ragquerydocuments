# ragstreamlit1
This is a simple application that evaluates RAG and Streamlit.

Bring-Your-Own-Key applies. You get no freebies from me.

GPT-4o seems to provide the best results, but GPT-4o Mini is probably sufficient for basic queries and is less expensive.

Check Verbose to see the prompt used with the LLM.

The applications is accessible here: https://ragquerydocument.streamlit.app/.

No guarantees for it not breaking in the future, but any obvious bugs should be ironed out before I update the code here.

Considered improvements:
- Selection of model
- Selection of chunk size and overlap
- Possible to modify instructions
All this can of course be changed in the code.

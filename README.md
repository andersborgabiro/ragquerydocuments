# ragstreamlit1
Application that evaluates RAG and Streamlit.

This is a Bring-Your-Own-Key application. You get no freebies from me.

GPT-4o seems to provide the best results, but GPT-4o Mini is probably sufficient for basic queries and is less expensive.

Check Verbose to see the prompt used with the LLM.

The applications is accessible here: https://ragquerydocument.streamlit.app/.
